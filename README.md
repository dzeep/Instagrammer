# Instagrammer
We are planning to make an application that will help to the people or corporations, who wants to market their products on a social media. The social media, where we are willing to develop the application, is Instagram.
The application will perform the task of finding individual customers and send follow-up requests to the customers. It will provide solutions to marketers who try to market their products to their customers with a special message.
We are planning to use C # and Selenium Library while developing the application. We discovered that we can use the Voodoo program as a result of our research.
Thanks to the desktop application we will develop, marketers will be able to send requests to the followers of their competitors and send mass messages.
Thus, marketers will not having to search for customers that they can sell their own products one by one. And they will be able to focus on the quality of the product, rather than how many people it introduces its product to.
